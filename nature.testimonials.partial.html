            <p class="card_items_text">" This was my first camping trip and it was one of the top vacations of
                my life. What a great experience and adventure! The guides were very professional, knowledgeable
                and experienced. My daughter loved the camping and we will continue exploring the country. "</p>

                    guides. We traveled to Yellowstone and are still impressed by the fantastic nature!
                    Everything was planned to the smallest detail, we only needed to take personal belongings
                    with us. "</p>

                <p class="card_items_text">" We decided to introduce our children to camping trips, they are
                    5 and 9 years old now. The kids really enjoyed such an active holiday. They learned to
                    fish in the lake, climb trees, make a fire. I hope they will remember some interesting
                    facts that the guides told us. Thank you! "</p>
